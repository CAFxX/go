// There is a modified copy of this file in runtime/rwmutex.go.
// If you make any changes here, see if you should make them there.

// A RWMutex is a reader/writer mutual exclusion lock.
// The lock can be held by an arbitrary number of readers or a single writer.
// The zero value for a RWMutex is an unlocked mutex.
//
// A RWMutex must not be copied after first use.
//
// If a goroutine holds a RWMutex for reading and another goroutine might
// call Lock, no goroutine should expect to be able to acquire a read lock
// until the initial read lock is released. In particular, this prohibits
// recursive read locking. This is to ensure that the lock eventually becomes
// available; a blocked Lock call excludes new readers from acquiring the
// lock.
//
// In the terminology of the Go memory model,
// the n'th call to Unlock “synchronizes before” the m'th call to Lock
// for any n < m, just as for Mutex.
// For any call to RLock, there exists an n such that
// the n'th call to Unlock “synchronizes before” that call to RLock,
// and the corresponding call to RUnlock “synchronizes before”
// the n+1'th call to Lock.

// events in order to provide the more precise model above to the race
